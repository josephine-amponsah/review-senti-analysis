They could not even recommend to me which of their listed food on menu is the best, one of the waitress mentioned she cannot recommend because it is not allowed. Their appearance was off for me also.

It‚Äôs the perfect place to calm down and just enjoy yourself. The resort is built with a great sense of design and atmosphere by a nice couple taking very good care of you.

The only bad thing was the internet connection that was weak, but if your not depending on internet - this is a perfect place to be."

Caution: Road is too rough. Consider Pick-up vans.

Beautiful sea beach with photogenic views. Clean area with water. The beauty of this place is the small rocky mountain ‚õ∞.. just walk 3-4 minutes and click pictures and videos there. Adding some of the pictures.water is green, grey and yellow lol..mix colour.

Make sure you order your food in advance as they will take 2 hours if they are saying 5 minutes. I had omelette and bread and waited for 1 one hour."
69,ChIJA2dVyhKc5w8RzaeO_CSow8E,2021-01-28T19:07:03.234Z,4.0,"An excellent hideaway vacation spot for the couple who wants to get away from the busy city atmosphere. A very serene area with a beautiful beach. The food is great but takes a long time to prepare. I recommend ordering early enough so as not to be disappointed. One needs to note, however, that the resort is very far away from the main road. The road is generally smooth though. We could not find the sign at the main junction and this we missed the turn and got lost. Be sure to ask for directions. You will spend about 20-30 mins drive from the main road on dirt road before you get the resort. After the main junction there are signs at each junction so you will find your way.
I recommend this resort for couples who want a quiet, low key and affordable vacation. Just make sure you have a 4x4 üòÇ"

123,ChIJ1UDAleSb5w8RuWaxYyv4Zd8,2023-03-08T09:34:40.122Z,5.0,"Green Zion Garden is an actual paradise. The various little/large rooms are like natural hobbit houses. No Aircon but sure a fan is grand. There's a tree house, too. The garden is immaculate, green indeed. Beautiful flowers, plants and trees. There are birds, dragonflies, a friendly goat, a couple of friendly dogs. It's right by the beach where Ellis has a beautifully decorated wooden bar. He'll feed you delicious veggie food and serve you tasty drinks. He's got the best smile. üíóThere are seats & shaded beds by the ocean. The beach is so clean- no rubbish. The cleanest I've seen in Ghana. I should have stayed for longer. I'll go back one day... The village of Butre itself is across a rickety Indiana Jones style bridge and is a bustling lively fishy place. The children all ran at me for fistbumps & hi fives. Goats & chickens & dogs everywhere.
We got a motorbike to Asa Baako Festival in Busua but walked back, the full moon illuminating our way across the beach, then our headtorches helping for the path through the bush over the hilly headland, with birds frogs & insects providing the soundtrack.
A very magical special place, which seems to be growing even better with each new build & idea. Loved it üòä"

Set in the serene and beautiful ambiance of one of Ghana's beautiful coastlines,the Green Zion Garden was the perfect location for good relaxation, good and peaceful unwinding. My host, Ellis was super amazing.  A super friendly, hardworking and open minded gentle rasta man. His vegetarian cooking was top notch. His knowledge and sharing of experience was great. He prepared a bonfire for me and he is a  kind of a good drummer too [but pretty please, don't let him sing :) ] The various lodges, from the dormitories to the upper deck of the tree house, were neat, lovely and awash with beautiful colors and traditional fabric.
Bonus: when you request for a coconut, you get a fresh one which is cut from the tree right in your face.
I sure will be there again."

Their staff were generally nice, but their services were poor. The breakfast buffet was very limited. We had the same options of food for our 3 night stay for breakfast.

I wouldn't add it to my favourite places in Takoradi.

Their front desk staff were very friendly and welcoming but two of the staff did not depict this trait. Their conference rooms were ok even though I think the arrangements of the furniture was not fit for purpose given the nature of our engagement. I didn't get to use other facilities such as gyms and so I can't attest to its availability or state . Overall it's a lovely place especially for a weekend getaway..

I loved our stay at this hotel. The room is fabulous. Furniture is so adorable.

The bedstead had this classy display of transparent material with super comfortable mattress and bedding.

The view from our window was beautiful. Showing the pool and vast green fields around the hotel.

Washroom, housekeeping and breakfast were on point. Rooms Rates are a little on the high side.

In the evenings during holidays, the live band music is a must. Anytime I‚Äôm back in Takoradi, I‚Äôll surely visit again."

We booked a seaview chalet but could not see the sea due to the back gate and trees.
The building needs to be renovated.

We didn‚Äôt have have hot water for the first day and night, this was rectified but our first showers were cold.

Chambres tr√®s diverses, allant d'une suite avec salle de bain, certaines apparemment sans, jusqu'√† la Beach House, accol√©e √† l'√©cole de surf du lodge (√† noter que ces derni√®res sont relativement √©loign√©es du reste du lodge, il faudra compter au moins 5 minutes de marche, en traversant le lagon √† mar√©e basse ou en passant par le village). De mani√®re g√©n√©rale, la route menant √† Busua et donc √† l'√©co lodge est plut√¥t chaotique et endommag√©e. Comptez sur un bon chauffeur et n'ayez pas peur du pont passant au dessus du lagon.
L'√©quipe est r√©active et arrangeante (nous avons pu changer de chambre au dernier moment √† notre requ√™te, merci Fredrick!).
La cuisine est proprement FABULEUSE, avec des plats vari√©s et un menu chaque jour diff√©rent, avec des produits locaux. Le chef saura vous surprendre avec sa cuisine authentique et faite maison.
Au bar, Francis pourra vous pr√©parer toute une gamme de cocktails plus savoureux les uns que les autres. Mention sp√©ciale pour son akpeteshie maison et sa bonne humeur :)

527,ChIJ5VyAhiGZ5w8RKN-oLKCZLGk,2023-04-25T09:57:21.741Z,3.0,"I have stayed at Ahanta for several days after a long journey through Ghana and enjoyed the calm and relaxing atmosphere a lot. The location is beautiful, I loved the tree shower. I felt close to nature and it was just next to the beach side. The staff was friendly, even though more information would have been helpful at the check-in. We had to approach the staff several times for upcoming questions that could have been cleared in the very beginning. The food was amazing (even though it was a bit pricier than at other places) and the outside sitting and relax areas are wonderful.

The only thing that really disturbed me/us were the rats in our bedroom and the washroom. We tried to pack drinks/snacks as good as we could in several plastic bags into out backpacks but still they entered the room and went into our stuff. I was personally very scared during night, because you could hear them and we saw them, too when we entered our room after a day at the beach. I called reception during the night, but they couldnt do anything about it at that point. The next day they offered to clean the room once more and fill certain holes in the wooden roof, but it didnt help. They asked for our understanding, because it was an ecolodge and animal-friendly place, but talking about rats I cannot accept that argument. Especially because later they offered us to place traps in our room (which is not animal-friendly) ;) Moreover, the next night when I used the washroom, a rat was in the bin which was supposed to be emptied during the afternoon cleaning. I only then read that other people had rat problems, too at Ahanta which for me made sleeping almost impossible.

Still, its a really amazing place and I guess one of the most beautiful stays in Busua, but the rat experience diminished the overall very good experience."

The rooms and communal area are very nicely done, very cosy and clean. 3 options are offered for dinner daily (40-70ish GHS) which were always very tasty, and as there's one big table it provides the opportunity to get to know the other guests. There are also cocktails available, and breakfast is better than the standard hotel fare.

Busua doesn't offer a lot to do other than surfing (offered by lovely instructors from Ahanta), so come prepared for a quiet stay with lots of reading. We also ate almost exclusively at the lodge as there aren't many other options. There is also the Ahanta surf/beach hut at the beach which is a nice spot to hang out. To get to the village or main beach stretch you have to cross the lagoon, which isn't all too pleasant and at several times of the day a bit dangerous with high & fast water levels. You can also walk the long way around, across a patchy bridge and through the (small and not touristy) village.

One or two other things that were less than ideal:
- daily wake up calls round 6.15 from our local rooster (in general we enjoyed observing the chickens/roosters, goats and dogs at the lodge though). Sometimes we were woken up by other animal noises during the night.
- due to the rainy season, everything was very slightly damp (bed sheets, towels, clothes) and drying was difficult, some things started to smell a little moldy
- the outside area could be improved with more places to sit, especially in the sun

Other than that we had a lovely, albeit quiet time, the staff were really great and if we come back to Busua we will return!"

The beautiful environment was just absolutely stunning. The tall old trees , the little garden and the use of every living thing there was breath taking . You have the option to use the big metal bridge to get to the place or to use the small river that collides with the sea. That was magical.

My first two nights we got the beach house which was detached from the eco lodge itself. It was right on the beach where their surf school is with a small coffee shop. The beach house was very beautiful , lively and with vibrant colors . There are two pets around . A cat and a dog which are both very friendly. You can take the dog for a walk I guess but you have to ask for permission first. And if you are allergic or don‚Äôt like them around you can ask for their removal whiles you stay there.
The inside of the space was beautiful and well taken care off.

We checked into the eco lodge space itself and the next day and it was so beautiful with natural and undertone interior.  Warm showers , free Wi-Fi and a quite and siren environment.
The workers are very friendly especially Frederick and Joy who were helpful whenever we had any questions and issues concerning our stay there . The breakfast which is included in the room rates were absolutely mouth watering. They had some good options to choose from . They offer dinner options of the day and we only took dinner the night before we checked out and regretted we didn‚Äôt eat there the whole stay because it was delicious . My stay there was in great harmony and peaceful and I will definitely visit this place again if I have the chance. I highly recommend this place. Thank you Ahanta Eco Lodge for this experience."

The road to get there was challenging, but worth the effort.  The prices are a bit high, but worth it.
Special place, even if you don't want to do surfing. Tends to be fully booked, so book ahead.

- So yes rodents were seen once in the wall, as mentioned in other reviews. Not sure if it's against the spirit of eco habitat to exterminate them.  however the nature of the clay / mud eco build means new ones can borrow back  in from the surrounding forest."

Let‚Äôs start with the positives: the location is great, just by the beach, the surf school and staff is amazing, surfing conditions are great for beginners and intermediates. The food is tasty and the normal rooms are beautiful, clean and well-maintained. The only thing that was a bit unpleasant was the strange smell of our bungalow and the pitter-patter of rodent feet heard at night which I can only assume were rats - but to be fair we did not see them even once, it can just be unpleasant if you‚Äòre scared of such animals and hearing them close by.
In the middle of our stay, a large group of 10-12 people arrived who threw a party with loud music, laughing and yelling until well past after midnight with no consideration whatsoever for other guests. Given that the soundproofing in this lodge is absolutely zero, it was impossible to sleep or even relax as we had the previous days - loud music picked up early the next morning again.
Given that house rules demand guests to be quiet after 11 pm, it was disappointing that I there was no intervention from staff or management. While I understand that facilities may want to accommodate larger groups or enable parties, I also think it‚Äôs only fair to give the other guests a warning or heads up that the quiet paradise getaway and relax spot they had originally booked is to be turned into what resembles a party hostel for the foreseeable future. For what it‚Äôs worth, after bringing this up the next morning the staff seemed genuinely sorry and explained that the party had gone on so long without their knowledge, but we had tried contacting the staff via phone without success the prior night - perhaps for future occasions, staff will either be onsite or available over the phone to avoid such situations.
We decided to leave the lodge early, but for the first half of our stay I would easily give a 4,5/5!"

A huge group showed up with loud music & party all night, loud music at the breakfast and no respect for the other guests. No reaction from the staff to interrupt it. No communication from the Hotel Management. Really disappointing!

For future stays the Management should give a heads up to the other guests that a party crowd is coming."

The owners dog has bitten my dog several times and even attacked me when I defended my dog. He also bites humans if touching him. Even though we agreed several times that this violent dog is staying inside the office while we‚Äôre around, he was still running around. They didn‚Äôt stick to what they‚Äôve promised us, which was unfortunate because we wanted to leave after the first attack immediately. But due to their promises we stayed. If we would have known that they have a dog who‚Äôs defending his territory by constantly attacking other dogs we wouldn‚Äôt have chosen this accommodation at the first place BESIDES we were told that this is a dogs-friendly place. I was especially shocked of the reaction of the owner Julia, who was reacting very arrogant after my dog and I got attacked, when we had to pass through the hall. To my defend I didn‚Äôt see the dog being there but when I saw him he was already on his way to attack us.
Except from the owner Julia, the team is very friendly, welcoming and makes you feel like home but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend staying there"

551,ChIJ5VyAhiGZ5w8RKN-oLKCZLGk,2022-08-18T12:56:03.902Z,3.0,"My partner and I stayed for a week with Ahanta waves and really enjoyed our stay.
The employees are extremely welcoming and friendly.
Nevertheless I want to address some things that I wish I knew before my vacation there.

1. The communication towards us costumers was fairly poor. For example did we not know that we will be charged for refilling our bottles with water from the communal hall. Neither did we know that breakfast was included nor what time it would be available. So we involuntarily missed the chance to have those incredible pancakes for quite some days.
2. The sea really smells. There is a lot of trash and fishing going on at the nearby beach. But if you walk further (ca.10 min) you will be able to enjoy a calm and extremely beautiful beach without the special smell.
3. There were rats in our room. And this was something, when realised, we really struggled with. Every night we heard noises but thought it were lizards walking on the roof. We have had our water and food poked holes into. But to be honest I just thought my partner snacked without me. The last night we then saw the rats walking up our walls. If we would have known earlier we would definitely not have stayed in that very room.

Ahanta waves is a beautiful place to unwind. It‚Äôs made with a lot of love and their food is extremely delicious (4-7 euros p.meal). We liked our stay but If the communication and rat situation were tackled our stay would definitely have been more enjoyable.
Wishing all the best."

I was in Ghana for a few weeks from the states and wanted to check out the local surf scene, so that is how I found myself at Ahanta Eco Lodge.

The room was clean, air conditioned and settled between large trees down a stone pathway.

The food at the restaurant/lounge area was delicious! Chef did a great job.

Bebe the surf instructor is a super cool guy that was eager to share his home waves and some technique to help me have an extra food time in the water.

It takes some effort to get to this place, but once there, its a really great spot! I would 100% stay here again."

We wanted to go away for a few days then come back but despite repeated asking they would not confirm if there was a room - which was unhelpful. The food is vegan only which was not clear from the website.

Nancy, die Gastgeberin, ist eine Perle. Sie hat uns sogar im Zimmer zur√ºckgelassenes Trinkgeld hinterher gebracht, weil sie glaubte, wir h√§tten es vergessen. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck ist gut, Nancy kauft sogar in Takoradi Mandelmilch. Die Zimmer sind ruhig und besser als wir bei dem Preis erwartet h√§tten. Am Strand ist man in 5 Minuten zu Fu√ü. Die Umgebung ist abends etwas dunkel, aber unseres Wissens nach sehr sicher."

I'm not vegetarian but did not miss anything. We could easily pre-order food over WhatsApp which was very nice. Abu is the guy who works the hole day and he can repair literally everyting. We wanted to make a long bicycle tour and Abu spent a full day just for us to make sure the bicycles are in perfect condition. It was a pure joy to stay there and I would recommend this 100%.

Our room was bright, comfortable and clean with clean linen and towels provided.  We loved the garden, the hammocks and the outdoor shower. It was a great place to relax. There is also a roof terrace where you can play games or relax. We extended our stay by one night and would have stayed longer if we could. We 100% recommend!"

- lekker vegan eten van Nancy,
- uncle Abu die altijd alles doet om het je naar je zin te maken,
- een rustige plek waar de koele bries elke dag een beetje beter maakt,
- een plek waar wij met onze dochter van 1 ook heel goed terecht konden, omdat de appartementen uitkijken op de tuin. Zo konden wij een drankje doen of eten terwijl zij op bed lag.

Al met al, ga je naar Busua, twijfel niet en ga hier heen. Voor mij de meest rustgevend plek."

Wouldn‚Äôt recommend the food, we paid 25 GHS each for very strange and unsatisfying veggie burgers that took over an hour to arrive. It was ludicrous, it felt like a practical joke. The burger was a tiny soggy mess on top of one slice of bread, and there were two pitiful slices of potato beside it. Very disappointing to two very hungry people. Other than the food all was well. If you stay here I would recommend seeking meals elsewhere."

Nancy was super helpful and made breakfast super fast every time - her banana pancakes are tasty! They dont offer coffee option during bfast, so you need to go elsewhere if youre a morninh coffee drinker.
As the guest of LG, you get to have a special offer for surfing classes, which is great. Also, they have a sister B&B by the beach called Coconut Dream that is a nice spot to hang out when you need a break from the sun.
It was further away from the beach than I expected and you have to go through a small neighbourhood of houses with limited access to water, which felt invasive some times."

The room I had, over looked the pool‚Ä¶ Very comfy beds ‚Ä¶ AC worked great!
great times‚Ä¶.

Bottom line! Ever time I was in need‚Ä¶ I was helped, from getting cash advance on my visa to laundry being done

It is some what mountainous, with trails.

I just want to clarify that there is no way the previous response was accurate because it referred to me receiving a discount because my father was arriving from cape coast. My father passed away some time back, I came with my friend, and we certainly did not receive a discount. The toilet seat was dirty, there's no way around that, I cleaned it.  I strongly feel in the service industry there is no room for arrogance but for humility and proving the best service. We did not receive that at Safari Beach Lodge. The kitchen staff was friendly but the food was late, no arguing that, even ask them because we went to ask for the food two times and they apologized both times. There was a group of 5 gentlemen also staying in the hotel so maybe that delayed out food. My main annoyance had come from one of the staff that seemed relaxed about the fact that our room was not ready. We had travelled for 8 hours and just wanted to rest, he kept telling us it as not his fault a lot of things had gone wrong that day. I really wish the owner would have been there the night we came, at this point its just my word against what the owner has been told. I am an avid traveller and take reviews seriously. I caution those that want to book at Safari Beach Lodge. I truly wish the renovations are your only problems and once that is resolved the place can operate normally."

I left Busua with a community of friends who made my stay unlike any other trip I have been on. Gina, the host, is beyond accommodating and her staff is friendly, attentive, responsive, and a joy to be around. The property also surprised me. The location is perfect, a 3-4 minute walk from the beach and the chaos of the ""downtown"" Busua area, and feels extremely private. The view is stunning, right on the water overlooking Busua beach and Abokwa Island. The rooms were spacious and clean.

I can't thank Gina enough for everything she did for us, and a huge thanks to her staff (shout out to Anita for making such AMAZING meals). I will not think twice about staying here again when I return to Busua. Until next time!"

1188,ChIJqd5rsmSZ5w8R-mD1iF5LUqA,2018-02-24T22:07:35.258Z,5.0,"Beautifully located small resort with six round chalets (1-2 persons each) with superb ocean views. An ideal place to just relax and enjoy the nice, quiet scenery at daytime with nothing but the breaking waves of the ocean and the crickets to hear at night. Nice, wide sandy beach is accessible within minutes by foot. The resort is in good condition (rooms with restroom and shower, moscito screens, fan, fridge, safe), especially considering that the place is in the heart of real Africa. The owner and her personnel are warm and very friendly and will do everything to accommodate your needs and make your stay a pleasant one. Even if you come for only a short stay, by no means miss the excellent cuisine; the owner and her assistant will prepare very tasty, freshly made breakfasts, lunch or dinner in local and/or international style. Full recommendation!

Eine wundersch√∂ne kleine Anlage mit sechs runden Zimmern im Bungalowstil (f√ºr je 1-2 Personen) mit herrlichem Ozeanblick. Ideal, um einfach mal auszuspannen und die sch√∂ne, ruhige Landschaft bei Tag und nichts als Meeresbrandung und Grillenzirpen bei Nacht zu genie√üen.  Herrlicher, breiter Sandstrand zu Fu√ü in wenigen Minuten erreichbar. Die Anlage ist in gutem Zustand (Zimmer mit Dusche und WC, M√ºckenschutz, Ventilator, K√ºhlschrank, Safe), insbesondere wenn man bedenkt, im Herzen des wahren Afrikas zu sein. Die Leitung und das Personal sind sehr freundlich, die Atmosph√§re famili√§r und alles wird getan, den W√ºnschen des Gastes entgegenzukommen und den Aufenthalt angenehm zu gestalten. Auch wenn man nur kurz bleiben sollte, darf man die sehr gute K√ºche nicht auslassen. Die Managerin und ihre Assistentin bereiten alle Mahlzeiten (Fr√ºhst√ºck, Mittag- und Abendessen) frisch und sehr schmackhaft zu, egal ob afrikanische oder europ√§ische Gerichte. Sehr empfehlenswert!"

Just stayed for lunch. Though we ate outside the tiny dining room inside is cozy.
Guess what my order (grouper) was cancelled after a few minutes because the fish wasn't available. I presume communication between kitchen and waitresses should avoid this kind of inconvenient.
Food was quite good and well presented, nice tasty sauces. A little more professionality would make the place very agreeable. One extra point awarded for the possibility to use Visa."

I travelled from USA with 2 teenage girls, Jan 2023.  We had a king size bed.  The bed was big enough for us to sleep comfortably.  Wifi is only available for 1 device per room.  Imagine having 2 teenagers that have to share wifi connection.  I‚Äôve never heard of this.  To top it off the internet cuts out at 12am sharp.  It‚Äôs as though they turn the internet box off.  Then they advertise free breakfast.  This is only for 2 guests to a room and you have to pay for the 3rd. The breakfast is the same for everyone. Absolutely no substitutions. The breakfast consisted of fried egg, baked bean, spring roll, bread and a bit of green salad.  Portion is very small.  The eggs were good.  Had to throw out everything else.  Very sad, bc I really love spring rolls but they were rock hard and couldn‚Äôt be eaten.  The pool is very unkept.  Water is dirty. Thankfully this stay was only for one night.  The staff made me want to pull my hair out!  They act as though theyre deaf when you are speaking to them.  They don‚Äôt like to be asked questions.  When you do ask they act as if they don‚Äôt hear or understand my plain English. Then when they respond in a very soft/low voice and it‚Äôs always sorry.  They are not informative, rather very timid. But they communicate loud and clear amongst themselves.  Overall I wish I could go back in time and get my night back."

However, the mattress was not as comfortable as I would like. My A/C was also non-functional. Alas, due to the full booking of the place, I had to stay as is. They also had no working WiFi. Plus, cellphone reception was terrible. The Hotel rates  on the other hand was very good."

L'emplacement est tr√®s agr√©able avec un grand jardin, des espaces de jeux et l'acc√®s au lac. Bel environnement, tr√®s paisible. Parfait pour l'observation des oiseaux (pr√©voyez des jumelles ou longue-vue)

Cuisine excellente, g√©n√©reuse et vari√©e. Tout est fait sur le moment donc il ne faut pas √™tre press√©. Vous pouvez commander en avance.

Les chambres sont grandes et correctes. Peu de pression d'eau pour la douche.
Possibilit√© de garer sa voiture √† c√¥t√© de sa chambre.

L'acc√®s est cependant compliqu√©. Les routes sont difficilement praticables. Assurez vous d'avoir le v√©hicule qui convient. C'est un endroit plut√¥t isol√©, comme les autres logements propos√©s autour du lac. Il faut savoir que c'est un ensemble de petits villages vivant ici.

I spent a night there. In fact, their service is top notch. The rooms are neat, my AC functioned well, the environment was neat except for the lake side which had recently been used by some other people before i got there.
The food is superb. I had the opportunity to take variety of their meals; Breakfast (Milo, pancake, bread with fried eggs), Lunch (Fufu and Aponkye Light soup), Supper (Banku and Tilapia plus Special local potatoes with chicken), i ordered for special pop corn, khebab and fried plantains. Their food is by far the best ive tasted from any resort.
The owner Maa Patricia is very friendly but  i met these two people (Solomon and Seiba), woooooooooow, their customer service and assistance is overwhelming. I will not hesitate to visit the place a second time.

Cons:
Despite the nice environment,  there were few negatives. The road leading to the place was very bad and far. There were no walls around the resort (security concerns), didn't really see any security guard around. They had some security cams but it was far from the car park.

But in all I really enjoyed my stay."

I couldn‚Äôt help but come here this weekend of my birthday Oct 2nd-4th! It was a magical experience as I swam in the lake Bosomtwe for the first time, I did my meditations by the lake at 5am with the birds singing the sun rising and the calm of the lake. The owner is an amazing person I came here in June because of how nice she was on phone and she hasn‚Äôt changed. It feels like home. They even made me a surprise birthday local food! I will never forget this weekend. The only time I saw her not happy was when clients came in with food and refused to pay for anything. When they were asked to pay nicely they refused until they were finally asked to leave. They rained insults on the whole place. I have never seen such disrespect and rude behaviour. If you have food just eat at home. You can‚Äôt bring food to a restaurant! Why do we do this to good businesses? Wildwin is an amazing gateway for nature lovers and the owner is the best customer service client I have seen. Anyways I have already booked my ticket for December 2021. Can‚Äôt wait to see blue and green birds and swim in lake Bosomtwe. I could live there all my life :)"

Ordering drinks and meals was an easy WhatsApp message. We ordered food one night, which was good and we brought bbq for the second night. I like that they allow you to bring your own food. The rooms are super basic but we spent all our time at the beach anyway. The beach is clean and safe to swim in. Decent waves for boogie boarding and even some surfing (there was a decent break down the beach a bit). It feels good to find a place to escape Accra and really be required to do nothing but relax."

Resort food is yummy. You can bring your own charcoal and grill food your own as well. Dmall nighltly bonfire (weekends only?). Small but clean pool. Very nice spot for families. Drinks were on thr pricier side, but you can order them up via WhatsApp which is convenient. Rooms had AC and a mini fridge - honestly didn't spend much time in thr room awake. No stores nearby so bring your own snacks and maybe water. Rooms get sandy - a floor mat would be nice inside the door. Manager person (owner? German lady) had great communication skills)."

It has a clean beach and view is picture perfect.
Service staff is very polite and professional in approach.
Long walks (7-10 Km) on beach is normal.

Ride the waves get your board.
Swings, hammock under coconut trees give you true feel of beach resort.

The outside: Arriving at the resort was easy we informed them of our arrival and someone met us at the gate. As you drive in you can feel the peace and serenity of the resort. It‚Äôs very clean and the beach is well kept with lovely palm trees and shaded seating tables by the beach side.

The Rooms: We booked a conjoining family room. I must say the rooms were a big disappointment. The rooms are extremely basic especially for the price paid and we felt inclined to chill by the beach till it was time to go to bed as the rooms are depressing and dark with bare furniture.

Food: Ordering food is very easy. A quick whatsapp gets you a quick response. However the food is 5/10 and overpriced for the quality. Ordered dinner the day we arrived and decided to find a local to make our meals for the rest of the trip. Cocktails are very nice. The blue diamond is as a hit. So was the Last Prayer

Overall the tranquility of the place makes up for rooms and the food and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm giving a 4*"

The food was great , everything on the menu WAS available , loved the grilled lobster, prawns provencal, and the sea food linguine , and the beach front was amazing , we absolutely loved eating our meals right on the beach front and falling asleep to the sound of the sea , a beach resort worth visiting , the rooms are basic but the beach is so worth it .I would do it again ."

Rooms are equipped with a specific glass that attracts birds and Around 5 am small birds just knocked my window so hard we werent able to sleep. We slept 4 hours roughly on a vacation night.

Many flies were around when we had breakfast.

The place looks nice but not everything that shines is gold.

Really bad experience overall mostly because of the lack of availability and caring from the owners.

Highly NOT recommended."

Bed was comfy and massive, and as a family of 5, they were kind enough to bring us a matress as well.

The outdoor jacuzzi was nice, and there was  pool and play equipment for the kids, which we all loved.

Staff were so friendly & welcoming, special mention to Jessica from the breakfast buffet she was so helpful and friendly, but all the staff were.

The only reason this does not have 5 stars is the condition of the roads & no transport provided from the hotel. Roads are awful. The potholes are massive.
Resort would benefit greatly, maybe having a contract with a taxi company or drivers to ferry customers to and fro from the hotel.
If you do get a driver organised, please agree prices beforehand, as we had someone charge us 100GHS to take us 10 minutes down the road, which is a lot of money.

Would definitely recommend the resort to anyone, and will definitely be back."

However, I give them 1 star because the most important thing to me was Internet access. It was the worse experience I've had in a while. It's a commercial property for God's sake.

What would it take to provide proper WiFi coverage for the rooms, conference rooms, and public areas like restaurant and pool areas? Some of us are happy to pay for it. But it was hard to even receive a single WiFi bar at most of these areas. And WiFi was especially necessary as mobile phone signals are weak due to the location's distance from the main town.

For this reason and their nonchalant attitude towards providing reliable Internet access (paid or free) to guests, I give them 1 star."

But you have to hassle staff to get your towel..nobody cares as soon as they take their money..Very Bad food service..food took over 2hrs after ordering when we were promised 30mins...

There are more resorts in the area that serve better food than here. My brother's rice was burned, they put too much oil in everything, and the wait doe the food is too long.
The rooms had nice mattresses but just a sheet to cover you, and the shower is unpracticle and a pain to use.

The pool was nice, although it is saltwater. The beach is in walking distance just past the beautiful stone wall (the pictures aren't updated,the beach isn't right there anymore) but you can not swim in there, the current is too strong! The people were nice, and the owner even tried to speak in french to my grandma, who couldn't speak English well.

I recommend this place for a night stop (with an extra blanket on hand) and to use the pool. The food isn't worth the wait"

We were greeted by Mr. Kweku who runs the operation. He quickly checked us in, answered some questions about getting around, visiting the national forest, and returning to Accra, and then insisted that we relax.  We were shown to our room by the excellent Mr. Henry and Ms. Vivian, both of whom kindly showed us around and ensured we were taken care of throughout our visit.

The room isn‚Äôt a room at the ritz. Let me confirm what some other reviews‚Äî it‚Äôs hot and the AC can take a bit to cool the room down. But on the positive side, the water pressure is great (and hot) and the bed is comfortable enough.

The pool is lovely, if a bit warm, and provides and amazing view of the crashing ocean waves, sunrises, and sunsets.

The restaurant provides a mix of western and African food which we really enjoyed! If you are visiting Africa and having trouble finding local dishes we‚Äôd recommend checking this place out even if you‚Äôre just visiting.

The lodge arranged drivers for us to the National Park and back to Accra at a reasonable price, and helped us get taxis into the city to visit the castles.

Overall an excellent stay!"

In practical terms, one would be wise to order lunch in the morning to ensure that it arrives in a timely fashion, as ordering in the afternoon may result in dinner being served instead.
In addition to this, the establishment is found wanting in several other areas. The quality of the internet connectivity is substandard, the level of attention and care provided by the food service staff is inadequate, and despite featuring a menu, cocktails are not available for consumption. As a result, these aspects are not deserving of any rating and are left unmarked.

Down side is restaurant service and food. Service is super slow and food needs improvement. Breakfast buffet was emptied by 9am with half of the guests were left in limbo. Tables couldn‚Äôt be cleared to next guest with no where to sit. Had breakfast next to dirty dishes. We had a 2hr drumming and dancing session around 8-10 pm which wasn‚Äôt ideal if you‚Äôre a light sleeper and also considering it‚Äôs meant to the a tranquil escape.

Very warm welcome on arrival. Staff polite.
Butler available at the villa which made life much easier.
We were shown round the beautiful resort and the beaches are ooooooooh.
Great scenery for picture taking. Look out for they ones waterfalls. Totally enjoyed my stay with friends. While touring the property it began to rain and out of no where staff appeared with umbrellas! Customer service is excellent generally.
However the staff embarrassed us when we were checking out. . A towel couldn‚Äôt be found so they demanded payment for it. This was settled when the towel was found at the villa and apology remdered. A very unnecessary and avoidable incident. And for the price paid to lodge, a missing hand towel shouldn‚Äôt be the reason to chase guests down.
That‚Äôs why I give 4 star. Otherwise it‚Äôs is heavenly.

This resort, I believe, does not make enough ""noise"" bcos mehnnn! They should! The resort I tucked away on the beautiful hills of Axim. It is a little out of town and even though I travelled with Larry who drove and I played the role of the Princess we were both mesmerised by the sight of this amazing place right on entering the premises. All the rooms are chalets with beautiful sea views that you only need to see for yourselves to understand the extent of the beauty I am trying to explain here! There is a beautiful pool downhill that one can easily sight from the top due to its extremely blue colour. The pool was very clean and very well maintained. The lawns beautifully manicured and the natural materials incorporated into the building of the chalets  together with the view give the whole place a very authentic feel and make one intuned with nature. The beach has lots of coconut trees and so there's enough shade to relax and enjoy the Sea breeze. Part of the beach is covered with carpet grass, which was grown by the resort. We were there for just a day, but the grill at the beach suggests fun nights at this resort. We ordered some drinks on ice and food üòã.  Of course, they didn't disappoint.The meal was super tasty. We were sad when it was finally time for us to leave. We have not stopped talking about Axim Beach Resort and Spa since we got back and, of course, am planning a long stay there very, very, very soon. The best resort in Western Ghana if you ask me and their prices are also very reasonable."

They have a swimming pool, a beach, a mini football pitch, and archery, all of which I had a chance to enjoy during my visit. The entrance fee to use the facilities was GHC 200, which I thought was reasonable was quiet on the high side for kids.

In addition to the facilities, the food at Lou Moon was also very good, it doesn‚Äôt come cheap. I had a chance to try a few different dishes and they were all delicious.

The customer service at Lou Moon was excellent. The staff were all very friendly and helpful, and went out of their way to make my day visit enjoyable. They were always available to answer any questions I had.

My only issue with Lou Moon was the refuse dump at the entrance of the hotel. It was a bit of an eyesore and detracted from the overall beauty of the property.

The Concept is good. I thought I was in for a good disappointment on seeing the main entrance and the bad road to the resort.

Reception was good even though I arrived a day before my booking dates!

I got the standard room for a night since my booked room was occupied.

My biggest problem was the bed. They're not spring mattresses and so you end up making craters in them after some time. Craters are not comfortable. Unfortunately, it's the same bed at our island room.

At the time, some construction was going on, which was for a pool...i was happy about the idea but not so much for the noise.

Food is good. Doesn't look enough but it is. But with one of my seafood dinners, the lobster was not fresh.

Regardless, I would go back one day...must be budgeted for though. üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª"

Despite that, I will return. The rooms are comfortable, clean and chic. The staff and service is excellent!! They are responsive and thoughtful without being intrusive or overbearing.

Fred our butler was the BEST when we return I hope he is still there. He was very attentive and met all of our needs. The villa was stunning to say the least. I booked from US and they worked with me for booking which was great. Cannot wait to return.
Con: it is not fully inclusive. For the price this is a standard and the only reason why I did not give 5 stars. Drinks are not included and you pay for all meals that aren‚Äôt provided in your package. Be careful and ask questions about your package to make sure you understand fully what you are paying for."

Very stylish rooms and villas in beautifully maintained grounds and complemented by friendly and helpful local staff. Ghanaian warmth and international luxury combined. Good watersport facilities too with a shelterd cove offering some protection from the ocean swell.
But take your own sandwiches or demand a self-catering facility. During our recent visit there was no sign of anyone with any cooking skills at work in the kitchen. We witnessed wonderful seafood being brought to the place by local fishermen but the food that appeared in front of us seemed to have come from a different planet. Old reviews of the Lodge praise the cuisine, but it has changed hands fairly recently and things must have gone badly wrong in the kitchen. The dining room is in a great location as is the bar, where the  cocktails are worthwhile thank goodness.
Unlimited potential with wonderful staff and luxurious rooms. But the food could not be worse. Nil stars for dining.

2022 - Looking through recent reviews I notice that many praise the food in the standard default way that is commonplace on the web. But there are still a few warnings about the catering appearing. So I stand by my advice. Self-cater after enjoying a drink and cocktails at the wonderful bar with perhaps a bowl of chips...."

No matter if you are into cocktails on a sun bed below palm trees (served by the friendly staff right at the beach), splashing in the waves in flat water or beginner-level surfing (a small selection of boards can be rented directly from the hotel and apparently the hotel can arrange for a surf instructor as well but I didn‚Äòt try), look no further than this beach resort.
Compared to other places, the entire spacious site including the beach is super well maintained and clean so you can enjoy nature to the fullest.
You can also dive into a number of activities offered by the hotel like hikes, visits to nearby forts or a stilt village river tour but we didn‚Äòt try any of those. Having a car at your disposal comes in handy as the transit to and from, e.g., the stilt village was much more expensive than the activity itself.
I recommend to afford the extra money and book a Deluxe Room in one of the bungalows close to the beach as the less expensive options are located on the other side of the road behind the resort and require a short walk to enter the main area which we thought felt a bit detached.
I can definitely recommend this place!"

Food was delicious and the stuff very friendly. If you want to stay directly in the beach front make sure to book the deluxe rooms, as the cheaper ones are located a little behind the Resort. We didn‚Äôt do any activities they offer as we found them rather expensive, so I cannot say anything about them.
There is the possibility to do laundry (extra costs) and you can pay via credit card. I would recommend staying here 100%."

We enjoyed the relaxation very much. The area is very beautifully designed. The beach is amazing, we could swim well and walk from there to Axim.
The breakfast was rather weak in comparison and price-performance ratio... the food in general was no culinary highlight but okey.
We were a bit disappointed about the excursion that they offer on the website. The small ankobra tour was not as described on the website (much shorter and less programme points for the same price). Also, the big ankobra tour does not take place every Saturday. We expected this and planned to fly home on Monday instead of Sunday to do the tour on Saturday, which was a bit a pitty.

Rooms are not well maintained. 3. The only difference between breakfast lunch and dinner was the bread and juices served during breakfast. Booked a stay for 4 days and had to ditch the last day because I was sick of eating the same food three times a day. Breakfast lunch and dinner gatherings looked like a 50th year old birthday party. There is no variety in the meals. Oh and there was a brass band playing PRESBY tunes or whatever. I thought it was independence day. Breakfast juice was frutelli. Water dispenser was not the best. Pool water üò©. Bathroom is unnecessarily big. And oh don‚Äôt leave your money in your room for house keeping. I m tired of typing just change your mind."

The room we booked for had a problem and we just couldn‚Äôt stay in there and when the issue was reported it took the reception forever to get someone to come and check luckily we met the manager when we went for dinner and he asked if we were enjoying our stay and we told him we had an issue he quickly arranged for our room to be changed. And they came back in some few minutes after we moved in to ensure we were ok with the room. I was really impressed because some resorts don‚Äôt respond quickly to the needs of clients. Their food was also nice my favorite was definitely the breakfast buffet. Even though I‚Äôm not a breakfast person I love breakfast buffets anytime I go on getaways.

We only were there for two nights, and although it was short, our stay was really really good.
The pool, the little houses with its special roofs, the vegetation, palms, trees, flowers‚Ä¶ the stone paths‚Ä¶ it all forms a perfect site to spend a few days totally relaxed, and if there are people incredibly kind and helpful as there really are, your stay will be as good as ours.

Thank you to all this people, to every one of them who were constantly there to make our stay so lovely as it was: Stephen, Solomon, Jeff, George and Prince.

(A little note: when you are at the restaurant, they take time to bring you your order).

Anyway, I hope we can repeat the experience, we will be delighted!"

From my balcony, the view of the sea, beach and the property line, gave me a beautiful serene feeling. The pictures online definitely match the actual property. The food, drinks, beach, pool, staff, and activities (African drumming and dance; beach bonfire; visit to local school) added another layer of greatness to my stay. The owners were on location and made it a point to engage with the guests. The staff was super accommodating, kind, and professional. I have to give a special shout out to the restaurant servers that gave me an amazing birthday song and dance! Emmanuel, August, Richard, Isaac, and Dennis- you guys were amazing! Lemon knows how to do it right- service, accommodations, activities, cleanliness, and attentiveness. Another great thing about Lemon is that at my request, they coordinated for me a visit to a local primary school. It is there were I committed to sponsoring a child for school supplies/fees. If you are looking to support a child's education
, ask for Dennis.
Lemon will be a repeat for me."

We stayed at the Lemon Beach Resort for a week and had a pleasant and relaxing time. From the first welcome to checkout everything was great! Kofi and all the Lemons in the restaurant and the whole resort took care of the guests very personally, individually and professionally.

Our room was very spacious and clean, the beds were comfortable and the bathroom had a large shower. The room had air conditioning, a fridge and WiFi available.

The beach is 4min walk away but the poolside is perfect to take a swim and relax in the sun with a nice drink.
Their restaurant offers good variety on international and local kitchen for affordable prices. The complimentary breakfast is good.

We recommend a stroll through Elmina market and city with its historic and colorful buildings. Also the Batic workshop, where you learn how to create your own Batic design cloth in a very friendly environment. Other activities are available on request.

I spent 3 nights here and I was truly letdown. First off, during the day I was out on work duties so I basically only needed the room in the evenings. There was no towel, no water, nothing. I asked for wifi and I was told the password would be brought to me. How? Nothing actually came. My first night I tried taking a bath and I realised the water leaked into the bedroom. Idk how but it goes into the drain and reappears under the sink into the bedroom. There were no floor mats nor towels like I earlier said. I think my room wasn‚Äôt made up after the previous occupant. So I go to the reception to make a complaint. I‚Äôm told they can‚Äôt change the room for me tonight because the manager isn‚Äôt available. Okay. No problem. So what do I do now? She says she‚Äôll get someone to come clean the room and then get a plumber the next day to check it out. After waiting for close to two hours, guess who shows up at my door. The receptionist herself with a mop and bucket.
I‚Äôm too tired at this point to complain. She said she‚Äôd bring rugs after mopping. The rugs never came. The next day I return, and my room hadn‚Äôt been cleaned. No housekeeping, nothing. The bathroom is still leaking. I go back to complain and the new guy at the reception looks lost.
Once again he says my room can‚Äôt be changed. After another 3 hours or so this guy brings rugs. So my room is semi flooded. I can‚Äôt take a bath. And my sheets are still old. No towels no drinking water. Nothing.
At this point I gave up and slept because I was exhausted.
Another thing. I asked about the pool which looked visibly dirty. They said it would be cleaned soon.
That never happened. I left before my third night because I couldn‚Äôt deal with the bad service and room.
Once again. Beyond disappointed"

There was a used bar of soap in the shower (it had hairs from previous guests stuck on it), although they gave us a new one after requesting it. We got lost on our way to the hotel and tried calling the reception but no one picked the call; when we finally found the place and told the receptionist about that, he just replied that the number was wrong on the website and they had not changed it yet. There is no WiFi, when we asked the receptionist about it they said 'it was advertised on the internet but the reality was it was not there'. TV didn't work well and the toilet was not flushing. Although we had already decided not to have breakfast there due to the disgusting dirtiness of the place, they came to wake us up at 7.30 am to ask for our order... Positive points: the bed was big and comfortable and the a/c worked well, it is closed to Elmina castle.
When we book a cheap place like this we are not expecting any luxury, but at least cleanliness (especially in covid times!) and politeness, which we unfortunately didn't get in here."

He took us for a walk through town to see the lighthouse (which had an amazing veiw) and everyone in town knew him. ""Rasta Kobi!"" the children would yell as we passed them in the streets.
The bamboo hut is very rugged, the straw mattresses a little lope sided and pokey, but the sunrises, stars, ocean views, bonfire parties and conversations were beyond what I could have hoped for. I would love to go back some day."

The best vegan food, the absolute loveliest and friendliest host you could ever wish for, and amazing ocean view from the balcony.

It's affordable, cozy, and the best place to just relax and live a good life when at Cape Coast. The castle is situated right next to Bamboo village, so it's right in the centre of everything.

Genuinely recommend staying there, meeting Kobi and his dogs, enjoying some bonfire on the beach kn saturdays with music and drumming and just enjoying your life!!"

The doors of the toilet and the bathrooms have holes but it's something that you can manage
An experience that you have to try
It's on the beach and almost every night they light a fire on the shore and play reggae music
There's a good and quiet atmosphere where you can relax and rest
The owner, Kobi, is a very nice person
It's 25 cedis per night
It's very close to the Cape Coast castle so if you're coming from Accra with a bus, you will get down near a fueling station from where you can take a taxi to the Castle
The sea in front of the bamboo village is not swimmable even if some people go and swim anyway
If you go to Cape Coast and you're looking for a cheap and easy place you should go there and enjoy the amazing view from the veranda(where you can sleep but be careful for the mosquitos)"

And Kobi is impossible not to love, he is a host honestly interested in your well being, and not only the money.
Thank you, brother!"

The room we booked had a mini kitchen area (YES!), be prepared to pre-prep the space before you settle in! At night the mosquitoes are on the prowl so wear long everything please. Be aware of the noise levels across this area the hill alone has 4 CHURCHES! No WiFi service was available while I visited during April 23 - 28, 2019. The awesome attendant was very accommodating, friendly, aware and vigilant; he knew when anyone entered and left and we walked late at night!
Also this space is rented out for weddings. What an awesome little spot for the price."

When I checked in at lunchtime the restaurant did not have any food or drink, guests were expected to order out if they wished to eat. When I returned in the evening, they were unable to provide dinner.Despite having 6 hrs to make arrangements they still still didn‚Äôt have any  food‚Ä¶  but they did manage to go out and stock up with beer!
My room didn‚Äôt have any towels and neither the a/c or tv worked. Nor did the sockets in my room.
The absolute icing on the cake was the total apathy of the staff who were sitting around on their phones or watching football. When I complained to the manager he simply laughed.
I say this - not as a privileged westerner - but as someone who has lived in Ghana for a number of years  ‚Ä¶.AVOID THIS HOTEL AT ALL COSTS. IT IS A DISASTER. Marks out of 10 - zero.
Update - 18 hrs after checking in 2 power cuts and one separate cut in water supply. All of which took several hours to remedy as they don‚Äôt have a back up generator."

We came in before 2 pm and we knew that that check in was at 2 so we waited until it was time to check in. The place was very nice when we arrived, very spacious and clean however once went to check in they said the room is still not ready.
So we decided to eat, so we ordered and the waiter said it would take 25mins. But 25 mins afterwards food and drinks haven't arrived yet. After 5 mins we got our drinks then about another 10 to 15 mins we got only 2 of our meals. The pizza tastes good but there was an overuse of flour at the base and I had to scrap it off with a knife. Then 10 mins afterwards the rest of the food arrived. The burger wasn't just a beef burger it was corned beef and mince which wasn't right but the tilapia was fine. We finished eating around 4 and still our rooms weren't ready. Then we went to investigate why our rooms weren't ready, after we made a fuss about why our rooms were taking so long we then guided to our rooms.Also the bathroom had a werid smell which was like they used bad cleaning products üòê The customer service wasn't great at all.

So I came back again, on behalf of my grandfather wanting to treat us. And on the 26th Match 2023 there's a buffet. The jollof was good as well as the fried rice. Snapper was lovely. The fish and snail soup was alright however the fufu wasn't very nice. I would say the food is way better than last time but still there's a bit of improvement they can do. The dessert bar could have more options
The fresh bread would be more pleasant if it was warm.
It would be better to have more of a variety with the food and to be lenient with the spices as if people from aboard visit it would be hard for them to enjoy the meals.
The Victoria sandwich just isn't right at all
The pineapples were nice and sweet
The puddings are nice and creamy,l
The tarlet was alright could of been better
Overall, it's way better than before"

The day after I arrived at Cape Coast, I called this hotel because I didn't like the Airbnb(s) I reserved. This hotel was my third move & the third time was the charm!!! üòå They were even able to send a car to pick me up from the Airbnb to take me to the hotel.

The receptionist was extremely helpful my entire stay!!!! I stayed for seven days & enjoyed myself immensely. The receptionist even worked it out where I didn't have to move out on the night that they were fully bookedüëèüèæüëèüèæ

The room was amazing & the food at the restaurant was ON POINT‚ÄºÔ∏è Perfect place to stay when visiting Cape Coast for sure!! ALL of the staff was WONDERFUL!! I spent a lot of $ in tips while staying here because the service all around was absolutely perfect üíØ‚ÄºÔ∏è

The free breakfast is a great introduction to Ghanaian foods. You have the option to eat at the buffet every day, all day, but you also have the option of ordering from their menu. I only ate the breakfast buffet & ordered from the menu the rest of the day. Their sandwiches are to die for!! üòãü§§ The only criticism I have about ordering from the menu is the consistency of the dishes. For instance, I ordered the Tuna Sandwich two days in a row, but they were COMPLETELY different each time ü§î. Both were so good tho LOL

This will forever be my go-to hotel while in Cape Coast, hands down!!!"

The serene oasis, where the sea and sky meet in an endless display of beauty, truly captivated my heart. I could spend the whole day just admiring the beautiful seaside.

Despite a few hiccups with customer service, my overall experience was nothing short of amazing. I do suggest that they respond faster to visitors' needs.

And the food? Whaaattt!! it was absolutely delicious, although it may be a bit on the pricey side.

But here's a pro tip - make sure to bring a friend with you if you want to capture some stunning photos of yourself! Trust me, the strangers around just can't seem to get the right angles. Don't risk going home with no good pictures of yourself - bring a friend and snap away!

Overall, I had a fantastic time and I‚Äôm very eager to go back for more!"

Nous avions r√©serv√© une chambre √† 600ghs la nuit via un interlocuteur whatsapp. Arriv√© sur place, nous d√©couvrons que le prix de la chambre a augment√©, passant √† 650ghs. Apr√®s explications il s'av√®re que c'est une erreur de la personne avec qui nous avons discut√©, qui nous aurait envoy√© les anciens tarifs. Donc ce n'est pas de notre faute... Et pourtant nous en avons pay√© les cons√©quences. Car au final nous avons d√ª payer le surplus. Aucune r√©duction n'a √©t√© propos√© de leur part, ni m√™me un cocktail de bienvenu ou autre afin de s'excuser de l'erreur ou de la g√™ne occasionn√©e... Alors oui, je ne suis pas √† 50ghs pr√®s, mais la m√©thode est discutable. Je ne trouve pas cela correct d'√™tre mis devant le fait accompli apr√®s 4h30 de route et de voir que la direction de l'h√¥tel n'assume pas son erreur. Dommage.

Pour le reste :

- id√©alement plac√©, √† 2 pas du CAPE COAST Castle, et acc√®s directement √† la plage. PLAGE ET OCEAN PROPRE (attention au courant qui est fort)
- chambre spacieuse et propre (ne pas √™tre regardant sur les finitions mais √ßa fait largement l'affaire)
- personnel accueillant, arrangeant, agr√©able et discret
- nourriture excellente et choix vari√©
- parking priv√© et safe

Nous avons pass√© un agr√©able s√©jour malgr√© le d√©sagr√©ment cit√© plus haut."

Das Restaurant bietet gute Pizza und langsamen Service. Die Musik ist unangenehm laut (im Restaurant und an der Strandbar). Wenn man Getr√§nke am Strand bestellt, dann ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit hoch, dass das √ºberhaupt nicht kommt.
Vor Ort gibt es eine Billardplatte, aber keine Queues und B√§lle. Wir konnten Tischtennis und Beachvolleyball spielen. Vor dem Hotel gibt es einen Basketballplatz.

Die Location ist optimal: direkte N√§he zum Meer und zum Cape Coast Castle. Bei der Rezeption kann man sich einen Taxifahrer buchen, der einen in den Kakum-Nationalpark bringt und dort auch wartet (450 Cedi haben wird gezahlt)."

The outer may not give you any indication of the good interior. The bed and breakfast place has about 10 rooms with water heaters and TV. Parking space would however be a problem if all guest turn up with cars that need to be packed in the premises. The street in front of the guest can be described as an artists impression of ocean waves carved on the ground. In all, I will return to this guest house anytime I am in Hohoe."

The atmosphere at night is terrible, totally destroyed by the bright cold white spot lights, absolutely tasteless. The food was delicious, the chef Mr. Brown is amazing! Breakfast is huge portioned. Prices for drinks overpriced though. The service and waiters are totally overstrained and lack professionalism, attention and speed, but overall polite and friendly. I stayed for 5 nights and had only 1 time room cleaning during my stay.  Overall average hotel quality, too expensive for what you get."

The beautiful country side drive up the mountains, the trees, chirping birds, even the air you're breathing in feels different over there.

Had their grilled chicken with saut√©ed veggies and it was nice (a bit dry though). Little fluffy kittens to keep you company while you eat in the open.
Was a short stop over and couldn't  sleepover but will definitely plan on  a return as rooms are affordable and within budget.

Gewoon een heerlijke rustige plek die toen aan een onverhard bergpad lag, maar nu aan een goed verharde doorgaande weg. Het eten is prima, de kamers ook, maar nog met een beetje charme van lang vervlogen tijden. Gewoon een heerlijke rustige plek waar je lekker niets kunt doen."

For example our breakfast, we ordered on evening before for 7:30 a.m., started 8:30 a.m. and the last of 8 meals arrived at 9:00 a.m.
For everything you have to pay extra. My advice never ask for the way to the waterfall. You have to pay 20 GHS per person for giving you the advice where the footpath starts. It is at the entrance road on left side. The owner confirmed that the fresh air is still for free  After 30 min you can arrive at a nice waterfall with pool. The upper pool has a very slippery entrance. Keep one person of your group outside to bring help in emergency case."

The service here was quite good. The waitress was very active and friendly. The only problem I had was that the food delayed quite a bit.

The place is still developing as at the time I went there as there was still construction being done around. You can either sit under a tree or sit under a shed and enjoy your meal.

The meal was just ok in my opinion. I had goat light soup as a starter and then had plain rice, sauce and grilled pork as a meal.

In terms of parking, there is ample parking space.

They also have a guest house where you can stay.

If you are in Ho, and you need a place to hang out with friends, this is the spot for you."

Aside visiting the Tsarley Korpey Beach Resort you can visit other resorts around it

I mostly visit historical sites so this is new to me plus what better way to start the year than trying new things right? Tsarley Korpey Beach Resort was on last year‚Äôs travel plan but I could not visit due to my busy schedules. It is one of the many beach resorts in big Ada and famous for its beach front view. As we left home all I had in mind was ‚Äòrelaxation‚Äô and enjoying sweet coconut juice..

At the last stop, you can either walk to the location with the help of a Google map or get on a motor bike for 3 cedis. I opted for the motor ride because I had no energy to walk, I had nothing in my stomach and feared the worst if I trek.

The Tsarley Kporpyi Beach Resort is a cute place with a calming aura, your ideal place to escape from your worries by just starring into the sea and listening to it move. The pool is side is spacious enough for a small group and it has poolside seats for you to relax on.

At the beach resort, you get a look at treasure island, one of the famous resorts and recreational sites in the country. Again, they have speed boats or cruise boats for small groups at a very affordable price at the resort. TSARLEY KORPEY BEACH RESORT, A BEAUTIFUL BEACHFRONT IN ADA.

Perhaps my dislike at the beach resort will be their conference like seats, they looked worn out and very uncomfortable. And also, the tables, you will have to lean in to eat. There were few seats available at tsarley kporpyi and also there was a group having a get together which meant we had to be moved to a different seating area. The washroom at the beach resort is neat.

We ordered fried rice with grilled chicken and jollof rice also with grilled chicken. The food did not take long to be served and it tasted good and the quantity was enough.

A plate went for 45 cedi which is average as compared to most restaurants.

Facilities Available

Outdoor Pool,
Restaurant.
Bar.
Boat Riding / Canoe.

Good music accompanied with good food and company got me enjoying myself. We stayed for over 2 hours and had to set off to beat the traffic on the Tema road. TSARLEY KORPEY BEACH RESORT, A BEAUTIFUL BEACHFRONT IN ADA.

In all I recommend the place to everyone, you will enjoy your stay. The beach resort is under construction so do not worry if it does not meet your expectations. I for one will visit soon when construction is completed.

I suggest comfortable seats be replaced in the meantime as they are under construction. Aside from that, I do recommend this destination especially for video commercials and photoshoot. A day well spent at TSARLEY KORPEY BEACH RESORT, A BEAUTIFUL BEACHFRONT IN ADA."

The beach huts are still in undercostruction I hope to stay in one next time I go back. Although the staff are friendly and polite. The general service needs to be improved. At times very slow with not enough attention to detail. I asked for wifi at the bar and was told to go to reception. I went to reception and was told only guests staying at the resort could have access. I told them I was there for the day would be having lunch, using the pool and bar but she still refused. In the end she said I would need to pay for it. I did do because I needed the wifi however I was disappointed by their policy. I hope they improve their service as I‚Äôd like to return."

No water and the electricity went out. We only stayed one night. The only reason we stayed was because it was too late to find another hotel. The rooms were awful. There was mold in the rooms. The cable didn't work and the TVs are old 19 inches.  They don't give you toilet paper, sheets or towels. The light switches were not connected. I did not feel safe."

Very natural and Afrocentric lodge. I love the serene and calm atmosphere. Rooms are very beautiful and aesthetically appealing with the view of the lagoon. Customer service was excellent especially Collins, he was marvelous.
We sent our pet along and they were very sweet and welcoming. Not all resorts are pet-friendly but they stood out.
Foods and drinks were great with very moderate prices. However, it would be nice if they added more food options to the menu.
They have a spa and yoga sessions üòÖ

Parking space is not a problem.

I had a massage which sent me to the other moon.. very therapeutic. Make sure you also join the morning yoga exercise as well. You can enjoy the ocean and the lagoon as well. Customer service is top notch.. professional staff only especially James. This is an eco friendly lodge so make sure you prepare as such. I was however surprised we had to pay for breakfast.. in fact this is the only hotel I have stayed in Ghana that required that .. I hope in future they work that coz it really catapulted our bills.

Everything was a 10/10 from the staff to the food to the rooms , which makes up for the long wait to book.

You need to book some months ahead to be able to get your preferred room as MMT is a hot cake.

And the lovely part of all this how the money from the resort goes back to charity and improving the lives of the community, this makes every money you spend here worthwhile.

Will recommend MMT to everyone."

The thing that bothered me the most, however is their payment structure. Hidden fees or errors on a permanent basis. Charged me too much for laundry service and even charged extra for accommodation even though I had clearly received upgrades at their courtesy.

The facility itself needs proper maintenance. Especially the Hoenymoon Suite is everything but pleasant. The toilets... jeeeez... scary to sit on em.

All in all I have to say that I leave this place with a feeling as being cheated on. Thx to the manager..."

Everything about Villa Awoyo is 5* and I intend to host a grand event there just because their services and venue is 1st class.
I have told friends and family all about our experience. Nice to know that Ghana üá¨üá≠ has exquisite locations away from Accra equally matching up to European standards."

Top-notch service from the welcome drink to the goodbye car-wash. It's the little things that makes one's stay amazing. Staff are welcoming and receptive to feedback and that's all a customer wants.

Koodos to their üë®‚Äçüç≥...we ate all the prawns & tilapia we could.  We were even lucky to catch a tilapia harvest on our last day. Zero mosquitoes people! Zero! So much cross-ventilation, airyness, and lightness to this resort.

Mind you, from my experiences, customer service is mostly a challenge here in Ghana (no pun intended). Management and staff were super friendly, professional, caring and very responsive. Talk about cleanliness and you have a very prestine, super clean resort that is quiet and actually therapeutic; At least for some of us who enjoys being in a very cozy, relaxing, quiet and private environment. My utmost respect to the owners of this resort for their vision and professionalism. Keep up with the awesome work you're already executing.

The place has a lovely playground for kids to have lots of fun for family with kids  but can get boring if its a couple with no kids. During our stay, the pool was dirty hence not  much fun for adults except the lake side view.

Meals at the Villa Awoyo deserve  all the compliment because it is really great. However,  for breakfast  we observed it was not as good as lunch and dinner.  Villa Awoyo should revisit pricing of meals and drinks due to their stern terms and conditions of not allowing guests to bring in drinks and food.

Rooms at Villa Awoyo are small but quite pricey given that their rooms dont come with a  mini tea bar where guests can easily have tea or coffee at their convenience which is a standard for most resort. NB: we lodged in their executive room."

Villa Awoyo is the perfect getaway for couples and/or families looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of Accra, and enjoy some quality time in a pristine and tranquil environment with premier amenities.

From the minute we drove through the giant gates of Villa Awoyo, we were drawn to the sky-blue water in the immaculate swimming pool, as well as the expansive playground featuring a basketball court, tennis court, swings, slides, playground climbers, see-saws, merry-go-rounds, and tubes. Nature is prevalent at Villa Awoyo with  two river decks directly on the the banks of the Volta River, and a fish nursery adjacent to the river decks !

The food at Villa Awoyo was delectable and incredibly well-prepared and presented ! The menu was expansive enough to cater to everyone in our group which included 2 young families (with 5 kids from ages 7 years to 1 year) and a vegan grandma. The service was quick, professional, and very respectful.

Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend Villa Awoyo and greatly look forward to my next visit !"

Our room was on one side and the pool, mini golf, tennis, etc was on another side where you can access by using an overpass. There‚Äôs a community path in between the reception, activity area and the restaurant and river view rooms. The buffet food was terrible. Mind you we paid for a full board and still had to order meals and pay for them. It was like living in a boarding house (If you don‚Äôt like what is served, there‚Äôs no other option). I even walked in on another customer complaining bitterly about his son being unable to eat anything from their kitchen. The only juice served at breakfast was processed mango. If you don‚Äôt take mango, literally go to hell üòÇ. The place looks really good in pictures and videos but very different irl. Their service is terrible. We kept asking for access to WiFi but never received it till our last day and it didn‚Äôt even work. The manager (Ernest) will listen to your concerns and tell you he understands your frustrations but nothing changes. I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs beyond his capabilities. You should have seen the shock I had when I found out there was a graveyard inside the place - pictures attached (not very far from the kitchen). After talking to some staff, I found out the whole place used to be a cemetery prior to the resort being built. That‚Äôs where my struggle to sleep began ( We had intended to do 3 nights but left after the second night).
I must say though that I enjoyed the river activities. Had a great time kayaking and enjoyed the boat ride.
The manager promised me pineapple juice after I expressed my concerns about mango being the only juice available, only for them to serve me fermented pineapple and ginger juice which upset my stomach after just a little sip. I‚Äôm never going back here and will not recommend it to anyone. You‚Äôre better off spending your money elsewhere or treating yourself at home."

Llegamos y las caba√±as que se nos dio no eran como hab√≠amos solicitado previamente
Quisimos ba√±arnos en la piscina y estaba sucia y sin atenci√≥n ninguna y cuando nos vieron all√≠ quisieron sacarnos de mala forma porque no estaba apta sin se√±alizacion alguna que lo prohibiera o alguien que previamente lo advirtiera
La WiFi nunca funciono y el servicio del restaurante muy malo hasta olvidaron una de las √≥rdenes

The crab in one was like a stone. The food inconsistency has been an issue every visit.
The other items bought were good.

The paddle boat was faulty but the kayaks were great. If you are in a large group the boat tour is a great value for the price.

The salads on the plates were attacked by these tiny black flies making it very hard to eat on the beach front, not sure if there‚Äôs anything they can do about them though but just be prepared to deal with those pests.

The rooms are nice.

I‚Äôve been there prior to them opening, when they opened and now, it‚Äôs nice to see all the expansion and developments.

Will have to go back and play golf and swim."

The swimming pool was very dirty without water exchange system, no one come around to attend us for about 2 hrs after that we went to complain to the reception, no towels were provided, there is nothing to drink or eat around the swimming pool. The standard room were clean. The time to eat was another disappointment because we requested for pepper free food and looked like we requested double pepper instead, at the end was imposible to swallow it, in addition they forgot one of the food of our friend. The time to pay was another story because the prices on the bill were no the one on the menu, the person Incharge said that the prices were increased but not changed on the menu but was not informed to us before the order. Really we decided not to go again. Sorry but we had a very bad experience."

5345,ChIJNa5mxEeF3w8RxQBQBQJuoFg,2023-01-02T15:35:58.131Z,2.0,Would Not recommend this place. 1) inconvenient location so nothing really around that you can walk to. This makes it difficult when it comes to eating and finding food to eat. 2) facilities are sub par. Had to lug one of my suitcases up several flights of steps because I checked in late and no one could help. No elevators and each floor had windows open so it was very hot and humid outside your room. Room was clean but king room was very small like a box . Bathroom windows permanently open so the bathroom was extremely hot. Several windows not fully enclosed which led to me seeing large mosquitoes in the rooms. Ultimately ended up changing hotels due to discomfort with the mosquitoes  and they had no alternate rooms available. This hotel has potential but a long way to go. 1) elevators needed or staff to carry bags 24/7 2) ac Units in hallways 3) all windows need to be able to close fully and 4) if food is served menus should be readily available as there are no other restaurants in that close vicinity 5) face towels in all rooms

It seemed as though the cleaners were not taking their duties seriously and were merely fulfilling a obligation rather than providing exceptional service.

It would be in the best interest of the management to address this issue in order to maintain a high level of customer satisfaction and prevent any further negative experiences."

The best thing about this hotel: is that it isn't far from Kotoko International airport; that way, you can always meet up your flight schedules on time, and it offers you the opportunity to feel the pulse of the city, and a great sight to the hustle and bustle of Accra. Just step out of the hotel, and you are right where there are so many cars, motorcycles, hotels and businesses. Not to forget that several hotels are its neighbors, so you have as many options - just in case.

My favorite street to stroll is Osu street (cos there's a few local food being served as you walk alongüòÇ), plus, just somewhere around Osu street is the sister Hotel called Roots Hotels (I had dinner here with my colleagues at the roof top)."

From the moment I stepped foot into the lobby, I was greeted with warm smiles and exceptional hospitality that continued throughout my entire stay. Without a doubt, this hotel has set the bar incredibly high for luxury accommodations.

The attention to detail is truly remarkable. Every aspect of the hotel, from its stunning architecture to the tastefully decorated interiors, exudes elegance and sophistication. The blend of contemporary design with subtle nods to local culture creates an atmosphere that is both inviting and enchanting.

My room was an absolute haven of comfort. The plush bedding, coupled with the panoramic views of the city skyline, made it difficult to leave the room each morning. The attention given to cleanliness and maintenance was exemplary, ensuring a pristine and relaxing environment throughout my stay.

One of the highlights of my experience was the exceptional service provided by the hotel staff. From the knowledgeable concierge who offered valuable local insights to the attentive housekeeping staff who ensured my room was always immaculate, every member of the team went above and beyond to make my stay unforgettable.

Dining at Holiday Inn was a culinary journey in itself. The diverse range of restaurants and bars within the hotel offered a multitude of options, each presenting delectable dishes crafted by talented chefs. The blend of international cuisine and local flavors tantalized my taste buds, leaving me craving more with each meal.

Additionally, the hotel's amenities were second to none. The state-of-the-art fitness center provided a comprehensive array of equipment, allowing me to maintain my workout routine. The luxurious spa offered a tranquil escape, where I indulged in rejuvenating treatments that left me feeling completely pampered.

The location of the Holiday Inn was ideal, situated in the heart of the city with convenient access to major attractions, shopping districts, and vibrant nightlife. Whether I wanted to explore the cultural landmarks or simply soak in the energy of the city, everything was within easy reach.

In conclusion, my stay at Holiday Inn was an exquisite experience that exceeded all expectations. The combination of opulence, impeccable service, and attention to detail truly sets this hotel apart. Whether you're traveling for business or leisure, I wholeheartedly recommend Holiday Inn for a remarkable stay that will leave you with memories to treasure for a lifetime.

I as well remember Freda, although she no more works there. Interestingly, the lovely conducts of these people kept me doing business with your hotel.
I have been lodging in your hotel since 2013 and with my tour consult, I have lodged several of my tourists from several countries, business partners, students, family and friends at your hotel...in the same vein, I have recommended your hotel to a decent number of people but it becomes really DISGRACEFUL to realise that your hotel has an UNCIVILISED, UNTRAINED, UNCOOKED, UNFRIENDLY, CRUEL and a VERY RUDE staff with the name RICHARD working there. Thus, I keep asking myself anytime I visit your hotel; if that boy ""RICHARD"" is there to CHASE AWAY your customers with his uncivilised conduct or purposely there just to FIGHT and INSULT every guest who comes to the Hotel...?
If your hotel really has a management, you must have gotten several unwelcoming reports from your guests about that boy ""RICHARD"". I have had several unbelievable encounters with him and I still wonder why the management of your hotel still harbours him... If you need to keep him to still work there, then it is the management's responsibility to school him properly to understand the nature of the business you run. He's been working there for years but obviously he is so daft not learn or at least to train himself for any further opportunities.
One can easily conclude that he has a problem within himself which he transfers to visitors of the hotel almost everytime...
You may have to note that, with such a bush boy, your hotel is never safe to host visitors..."

I found it on the Hopper app. I stayed in one of their Executive Suites. It had multiple outlets to charge my phone and other electronics, a tv, very cold refrigerator, a fan, and a beautiful balcony to look out at the pool. The staff were helpful and welcoming. The only set back is the bathroom could have been a tad cleaner. On the bright side, my room was cleaned each day and I stayed 5 nights. Still overall great experience and just 20 mins from the airport."

When i went to their restaurant the menu look good and also their pricing. But chef they hire can only make yellowrise and fried rice so very disappointing. The breakfast was surprisingly good egg. Saled with sausage. I did not get my oats as promised. In the room there is free coffee and tea but no cooker for boiling water. When i told them they did not bring it. The pool area was good. If the management step up their duty it could be a great hotel to visit as for now i only wanted to stay one night closd ny there are another hotel to half if their price witj good restaurant food

No one wanted to give us access to the video recording when I realised my phone was stolen and I was promised to be call back the next day by the manager.
I was never called and my friend has to call multiple times to remind them to get back to us.
When we finally had access to the recording I realised that the video was cut at the exact moment my phone was stolen and then everything was erased - the reason was that there was a power cut that explained the ¬´¬†not complete¬†¬ª video whereas I was there and there was no power cut (no light off, no music off).
Those people are liars, they actually covered the person who stole my phone and reading through the comment it appears that it did not happened to me only."

My friend's phone was stolen, at a party there with at entrance fee. They deleted the part of the recording where it was happening which means it was probably done by someone from the staff. We followed up several times and they never even replied.
Security is hanging around with bullet-proof vest for nothing.

The duvet or blanket smells very bad, like it's not been washed.
Management should seriously look into that, until they improve it's a no no for me.
Flask for breakfast is rusted, the cutter to open a milk was not washed. It was a horrible experience for me.
It's a no no."

It is my  favorite place in Ghana; I loved the elegant ambiance and delicious food which is always exquisitely presented.

On this occasion, I am concerned as the doctor has placed me on a low FODMAP diet to address the food allergies and intolerances I am  currently suffering (including dairy, nut and gluten) In actual fact, I had no need to worry, my special dietary requirements were very well catered for. Apartments are luxurious D√©cor
an excellent choice for rest and rejuvenation. Well-known for its family-friendly environment and proximity to great restaurants and attractions, Number one Oxford makes it easy to enjoy the best of Accra.

As your ‚Äúhome away from home,‚Äù the boutique hotel rooms offer a flat screen TV, air conditioning, and a refrigerator, and getting online is easy, with free wifi available.

Guests have access to a 24 hour front desk, a concierge, and room service while staying at hotel In addition, Grand Number one offers breakfast, which will help make your Accra  trip additionally gratifying. And, as an added convenience, there is parking available to guests.

Highly recommend and will return."

The rooms are actually small apartments so this means lots of fantastic space. They are modern and spacious and very well kept. The shower was a little on the small side but nothing to much to complain about. Oh yes the pressure from the shower could be better.

The breakfast was very good with a great choice of local dishes and pastries. Mixing you western and local culture very well. I never did dinner there purely because I wanted to explore the local restaurants and try authentic traditional foods.

My only small issue is the location. It's far from the Central Business District meaning that if you have meetings in the city then you need to leave 30 mins or more before the meeting due to the traffic. And likewise coming back can take a while due to traffic. Apart from that it's a great place to stay in Accra."

On the outside, the hotel looks very eye-catching and attracting but if you actually put time and money into going there you will realise that it was a bad decision.
When I visited, I was told the WiFi was down and to make matters  even worse,I wanted to watch some TV and I noticed there was no decoder. The TV was big but it wasn‚Äôt useful since I could only access satellite channels.
I didn‚Äôt have anything else to do, so I decided to take a dip in the pool, which was a terrible idea as the pool was dirty and filled with dead bugs and I saw that as a health hazard so I didn‚Äôt even bother going in.
The only good aspect of my stay was the food."

But the bathroom shower door made it near impossible for me to get into the shower cubicle. A slimmer person could wangle through, unless they change the orientation of the door.

Other than that? It was worth the money spent. Clean, affordable, not too far from the airport, courteous and helpful staff, lovely ambience."

The staff are welcoming, especially at the front desk. The food quality at the restaurant is superb, I highly recommend the chicken alfredo and the burgers. The cappuccino they make is the best I've ever had.
The swimming pool is very clean and visually appealing, as is the gym and pool tables.
Massages are available to book also.
Even the most basic room comes with a fridge/freezer and kettle, and a fantastic shower. Rooms are very secure.
I will definitely be returning here on my next visit to Ghana.
If the manager is reading this review, your hotel is amazing and your chef is a huge asset!"

The local bar was set up beautifully, the downside was the coconut‚Äôs were not properly opened hence making it quite hard to drink.   Their main meals were cooked to perfection. Asked a couple of people that tried different meals and it was a 10/10 for them.    I didn‚Äôt really try much of the desert.  But I liked the Oreo cake. I‚Äôd definitely recommend.   And big ups to the team that attended to us."

The environment was neat, thy had a spacious car pack with visible security personnel all over the place. The staff were so welcoming, neatly dressed and professional with their duties. I only had a cocktail and I can say it was good. I am unable to comment about their rooms and other amenities since I didn't use them. The programme I attended was organised in the Botsio hall and the place was well kept with lightening, Wi-Fi, microphones, wall mounted projectors and air-conditionrers were all functioning. I must say it is  a pace worth visiting."

The facility is moderately priced but value for money is not fully realised especially with the breakfast that we were not given a chance to choose or say what would work for us. They only brought breakfast and we were supposed to just accept it.

The rooms are air conditioned and offer a quiet place to sleep.

The rooms have a safe and fridge.

We were not given complimentary water even though they stated this was part of the package.

The wifi is very good at all places in the hotel.

There is free on site parking that is secure.

There is a good conference facility though we did not use it.

The TV are very big, great movies available.

The menu in the rooms did not tally with the one at the cafeteria, confirm on prices before ordering."

It was an excellent choice as compared to other hotels in the city this is not a tall skyscraper but rather a three-level hotel with tranquility and plenty of vast green spaces. In fact, a vast sanctuary with plenty of room to rest, relax and do business.
Ideal for the weary traveler looking for clam and peace this hotel is a resort with friendly staff from the reception to the housekeeping all greeting their guests with a smile. I chose this hotel the second time of my travel to Accra and was delightfully pleased with the consistency of the service.

The hotel has a large restaurant that serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner with an impressive buffet and plenty of seating capacity both indoors and outdoors by the poolside. The restaurant serves both local and international cuisine with a variety of seafood options. Service and hospitality are impeccable in true Ghanian style. The staff are always smiling and ready to help with their guests‚Äô special dietary requests.

The pool side has a bar that serves all kinds of alcoholic drinks and is a beautiful place to unwind in the evening with music from the ninety‚Äôs playing all night long and if one would like they can watch a game of football on the large TV screens outdoors.

The hotel has a shop that sells large paintings from their resident artist Mr. Kofinduro. His paintings are worth owning and Kofinduro himself is readily available to explain the meaning behind his painting. An always smiling humble gentleman, I‚Äôm putting up some of his work of art and his photo with his permission. Please do buy his paintings if you are an art lover and let his work of art adorn your home or office.

A special mention for Ms. Francisca at the restaurant who was ever smiling with a pleasant demeanor and ready to offer suggestion and accommodate by a-la-carte-request. A shout out to Ms. Linda from the reception for your impeccable service and all the housekeeping staff who readily greeted all their guests and tidied my room for me."

Customer service is terrible. They don't even pick up your calls. We got there at 7pm and were told there is no food because the kitchen has closed. At 7!! The bathroom for the ""King Suite"" had no running water and didn't even have a tub. In the end we had to pay for lodging at a different place and move.

Worst of all they didn't give a refund even though we booked for 2 nights and couldn't even sleep there for one night."

It is expected that you bath out of a bucket. The internet service is terrible and management refused to fix it. I had to move out early on a monthly and management is trying to hustle me out of the money in thinking that I would be leaving the country. I will try to contact corporate at a later time. The only good thing is the chef. But I don't think the food is sanitary because of  the amount of bugs. The hotel need to be torn down and rebuilt . It is a love motel at best. I had so many problems the staff became ashamed to me.

6897,ChIJ8QycOJWQ3w8RTvbJ89Uqi1c,2023-03-13T09:14:51.666Z,5.0,"I asked for the cheapest room so if course it was basic- you get what you pay for. (140ghs a night, marvellous) I should've brought my mosquito net- the bed was comfy but the pillows weren't, there isn't glass in the windows but there is mesh. (The mozzies must've come through the cracks in the door). The lock was just a wee padlock but I felt safe cos only the guests could get to that part anyway. There's a plug in fan & the view over the sea is amazing (though the amount of rubbish in Ghana breaks my heart). There were 2 shared toilets and bucket shower- it was fine. I don't think even the must expensive room has ac (but prob have their own bathrooms) but it's all good value. I loved the sounds of the waves and the birds singing. There are cats running about too. üò∏ They also let me in rather late one night (I woke them up, sorry guys) & were nice about it. The food is veggie (and delicious) which was a nice surprise after Ghana's usual meat/fish heavy diet. I had forgotten what mushrooms look like! The place is in a really central handy location. I got taken (by friendly folk) to the art market and to Abajo arts centre and saw a local traditional band- it was really good. I also saw the Kake Dance Ensemble practicing- 65 children dancing, drumming, singing (original songs!) and doing the most fantastic circus acrobatics (over hard concrete! No-one fell!). Look them up & follow them on the socials. They practice at the Rising Phoenix 3 times a week.
All in all, it's an exciting, friendly, vibrant place."

No nothing.

The view is good. That is the only good thing in here, but lots of trashes are in the sea.

Also it is too hard to find the location. You have to pass through some dirty places to come.

It does not worth the price.
Pay little more and go other better place."

No tuvimos TV, ni WIFI ni A/C, ni ba√±o en la habitaci√≥n (otras s√≠ tienen) pero ni falta que nos hizo. EL taxista no ten√≠a ni idea de d√≥nde estaba el hotel y nos perdimos. Al llegar de noche fue un poco desconcertante. A la ma√±ana siguiente cuando sal√≠ de la habitaci√≥n no daba cr√©dito: las vistas al oc√©ano y al puerto de pescadores, y la arquitectura del hotel (mayormente de madera) eran como un sue√±o. De aspecto colonial, rodeado de vegetaci√≥n y distribuido en diferentes ambientes para relajarse, comer, comprar alg√∫n recuerdo o disfrutar de un espect√°culo en su mega escenario, no te da tiempo a aburrirte. Tambi√©n est√°n los animales, gatos y gallinas que sin ser pesados te entretienen con sus juegos. Las ratas gigantes que se paseaban por el tejado los primeros d√≠as haciendo bastante ruido fueron capturadas, m√°s que nada para cocinarlas. Hay que mencionar que nos ofrecieron probarlas (en broma). Buena m√∫sica todo el d√≠a. El jefe nos atendi√≥ y fue muy amable con nosotros. Admito que fue un poco una aventura. Pero si sabes apreciar lo sencillo, el hotel es un lujo pr√°cticamente regalado."

The hotel has a colonial style to it, a bit of an older property but they do a great job of maintaining it well. The pool, poolside bar, and poolside restaurant have a resort vibe to them. You also have a private beach out back for residents and it‚Äôs a short walk to local restaurants and bars. Yes, you can hear the music from the neighboring establishments, but if you didn‚Äôt google how accra likes to party and how Labadi beach area is a focal point for entertainment in the area then that is your fault in my opinion. If you‚Äôre on a real vacation, it won‚Äôt bother you much.  Unfortunately I got sick during my last 48 hours of my stay in Ghana and didn‚Äôt get a chance to enjoy Accra for all it was worth, but that is where the Labadi beach hotel staff really shined ! A few staff shout outs‚Ä¶.

Mrs. Irene (House manager), an amazing lady who really took care of me when I was sick. She instructed the staff to do everything in their power to make me comfortable during my last day there when I wasn‚Äôt even sure if I could fly because of how sick I was. She had them make me a special soup, gave me liquids, and checked on me. She really is a wonderful person, and I can‚Äôt thank her enough for how she treated me. Most hotels would just want you out of their hair in that condition. She took care of me like I was her own son until I left for my flight.

Mrs. Linda, I believe this was Mrs. Irenes assistant manager? Either way, she was equally amazing and took care of me as well. Constantly checking on me and insuring I was accommodated with the food staff and instructed them to give me whatever I needed to recover.

Mrs. Abigail (Nurse at Hotel). Wow ! This lady is just wonderful. She came to my room and cared for me and checked on me, even having to walk around my throw up in my room to care for me. She was professional, sincere, and cared for me with the upmost standards of care. There was a moment where I was concerned I would have to go to the hospital and she could see that I really didn‚Äôt want to do that so she cared for me the best she could but I could tell that if I got worse she would make the call for me to go. That really comforted me knowing that she was fully aware of my situation and was in control professionally and medically of my wellbeing.

Ebenezer (Hotel Lobby Bar). This young man served me several times during my stay and even during the morning I was sick. He‚Äôs a great member of this staff. Attentive and responsive service. I appreciated him during my stay."

The music in the club next to the resort can be too loud for those who wanna sleep early. But if you enjoy partying, clubbing n good company, you are in the ryt place.

The rooms are clean, beds comfortable, good unlimited wi-fi. The view of the beach when sitting on the deck is magnificent. This place is ryt on the beach and you get to play beach soccer, volleyball and have a nice walk. Another advantage is that, it is a 3 minute walk from the Cape Coast Castle. Infact, when sitting on the deck, u can see the castle.

Breakfast is good although it is the same everyday. There is a variety to choose from for lunch and dinner. Try Fish and Vegetable rice and you will thank me later. It was the best I have ever tasted. Remember to place your order early because the meal will be prepared from scratch specifically for you.

The lodge has expanded their outside seating area with a rooftop deck that has amazing views on the beach. Evans is an outstanding host to his guests, very accommodating to all our needs and more. Besides the close proximity to the castle (less than 5 min walk) and the direct beach access, the food should be another reason to book here. The chef prepares the best seafood for a great price. The bonfire and music in the evening creates a magical vibe that you don't find everywhere. Highly recommended. We will be back, thanks again for the great care!"

Der Dorm was super dunkel und ungem√ºtlich, au√üerdem waren √ºberhaupt keine anderen Reisenden dort, mit denen man Kontakte kn√ºpfen k√∂nnte. Nachts kann man auch nur schwer schlafen, da direkt neben an so etwas wie ein kleiner lokaler Club ist, mit mega lauter Musik. Bin dort so schnell es ging wieder weg.

Now.. We chose this place because of the highly rated reviews but they are not giving the full picture. The standard is poor for my taste when it comes to the rooms. There was a lingering smell in the bathroom as the toilet does not flush well. The towels had stains and there was no blanket only a thin sheet.

If you need somewhere to lay your head one night then it‚Äôs ok. The price is a bit much for what they have to offer.

Very nice ambiance in the restaurant area with access directly to the beach. Food was good too. I had lobster spaghetti and my husband the chicken and fried rice. We both liked it.

The 3rd star came from great customer service."
